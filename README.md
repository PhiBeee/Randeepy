# Randeepy (Placeholder name)

Simple website to randomly go through images in public chibisafe albums  
(This one is currently limited to albums hosted on eepy.ca)  

# Functionality

- Save images into a favorites list to find them again later (and download later on)  
- Add your own custom public album to the list  
- Select which album you want images from

# Serving

Currently this can be ran locally by running  
```
dx serve
```  
in the main directory, which will serve the website to `localhost:8080` or basically `127.0.0.1:8080` in your browser.
